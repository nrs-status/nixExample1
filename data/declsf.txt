and this is your reference number to quote tomorrow at Euston station
and the ticket will be waiting there at the train station
i've already spoken to somebody earlier
he has a a family railcard
the rest of the adults pay 30 pounds 70
and it's 
 you said 1 44
i'm going to have to arrange for the person to collect the tickets at the train station
if you just bear with me
i'm just going to get a booking form to fill in refax to the train station
the 15 35 on Sunday from Euston arrives back in Warrington Bank Quay at 18 03
then the outward service tomorrow in 8 34 arrives at London 11 15
it's 4 adults and 4 children on 6 family railcard

4 of them will go on the railcard
one'll have to pay a normal fare  
it's 4 adults and 4 children with the family railcard discount
and the total cost is going to be 155 pounds for the four adults and four children
we need to actually fill out the form twice because it's classed as two separate journeys 
it's a diner's card erm 
postcode i don't know
i need the full credit card address
the only thing i've got is his number 
i don't have an address
but we do need the credit card address details
we 
it's i've got it
it's American Express
i'm afraid i can't take the booking until you find the appropriate address
he's not
he's in a meeting
i'm afraid you... we're going to have to wait until he comes out of the meeting then and give the ring back to book this 
you just need the credit card's address
we need the full credit card details address 
if you hold on
i can get it off anoth... another person
i've got a 
i'm using a credit card to pay for this
erm i'm wondering if there's any erm seats available on the super saver
      it's going from 
it's either 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock
that's no good 
that is a super saver is it
that's the super advance
that's it 
you have a you have a super saver one as well don't you 
that's the 
i don't know what you super saver
ah there's two there's two types i'm told 
there's the super saver
the super advance
you've got to book beforehand
but that's only available in the dates and times
the super saver is not valid at that time in the morning
and that's your standard open
i can do that for you
it's the sixth of October
and i've booked forward facing non smoking table seats
and the dates times and seat numbers will be printed on the tickets for you
if you needed to change any times you can do so
if you miss any train you can get the next available service
you can cancel cancel that any time 
cos it's a standard open ticket
it's er Barclay card
it's Visa Silver
that's ok
the ticket will go out in the first class post this afternoon
i should get it tomorrow
i see
the credit card number is
this is the reference number the ticket has been booked under
and the ticket will be posted out first class post this afternoon to you ok now
but it's also printed on the tickets as well
i... it's just a single ticket
i think it's the tenth anyway
the trains run at quarter past and quarter to the hour
the cheapest single fare is 7 pounds
and that's your Virgin Value single
but you've got to stick to the date and time that you book
there's a train at 13 15 from Birmingham New Street 
you arrive in London Euston at 15 hundred
that sounds fine
you want me to book that ticket 
and that's 7 pounds for your single
it's the tenth of October Saturday 
you're travelling from Birmingham New Street at 13 15
and you must stick to the date and the time that you've booked with this kind of ticket
i just have a question first before i i purchase my ticket 
there is s... some restrictions with the saver return
if you just bear with me 
i'll get them for you
with the saver ticket you can travel on any train after 6 20
if you're travelling back on a Sunday
it's any train
but if you're travelling on a weekday Monday to Friday 
you can travel on the train after 
but you're not allowed to travel on the 16 hundred 16 05 17 hundred and 17 05 
basically if it's the Sunday you were travelling back
you come back at any time
i can't travel down after 6 in the morning
that leaves it open
oh that's good 
you need to buy it at the booking office before your board the train
or i can provisionally book it and arrange for you to collect the tickets at the train station
as long as you are a credit or debit card holder
whether or not you might not manage to get on that particular train
if the seats were all booked or if it was busy 
but this is like a walk on fare
and it's what you'd always be charged as long as you're travelling at the appropriate times
cos that i'd know what train i was taking down there
but i'd need to definitely get on that train
if i book it for a certain time going down 
you can do that with this kind of ticket 
or it might be one after
but it won't be earlier than that
i'll just check the time 
you want me to book that one for you
if if that's poss...
just so i can make sure i've got a seat on there 
i mean...
it might i might be going on a later train
but it won't matter if the ticket says that time will it
i'm just going to book your seat now
the only seat that i can reserve you in is in the smoking coach 
that train must be particularly booked 
the only seats are left are in smoking
that's that's alright
and that's smoking
and that's on the 15 20 train tomorrow from Preston 
just get the arrival time again
erm i'll leave the return journey open yeah
you can leave it open for the calendar month 
if it's a Sunday you're coming back
y... come back at any time
but there is those restrictions on the week day that i've explained to you
it's 7
and it's Lancashire
it's 0 1 8 hundred
it's a full refund less 5 pounds admin charge
the total price is 51 pounds return travelling tomorrow on the 15 20 train
that's the second of October
it's a Mastercard
and the Mastercard number is
it's 7 8 3 3
it's the four of the first
it's em the year two thousand and one 
it sounds funny when they 
if you collect the tickets 90 minutes before departure time at the train station 
at Preston you just need to go to the travel centre
and you'll have the tickets there
