this is A 
this is B 
i need to change um C D's coming back trip from Washington D C on the 19th of July 
he wants to take the 1:40 from Dallas to on United 
that's United 1 9 5 on the 19th 
this ticket was issued 
i'm going to request 27 B 
but i'm not sure 
it looks like it's airport check in 
we're going to have to reissue the ticket 
because there was a 25 percent penalty on that 
we're going to have to void that 
it'll still be the same amount or 
i'm checking that the fare 
it's still the same fare 
i don't 
it's supposedly coming today 
i haven't u... 
i'll have to call F 
cos it has to be in today 
or it will or he will be charged a penalty 
it's by tomorrow 
i i mean by Monday 
we can't void it
the new ticket shall be sent 
i think Monday's fine 
it changes so much 
we issue so many tickets 
i'm going to set these up to be issued on Monday 
if he changes again
we don't have to keep reissuing tickets 
i wanted to uh um get a flight um to Los Angeles and back uh leaving on Friday uh 
this is A B 
i'm sorry 
this is personal 
and the date you wanted to go to Los Angeles is 
whichever's cheaper 
and i wanted to return on Monday July 31st 
a... a... when
i think i'm going to check the fare 
should be the same out of either airport 
it's it's going to be the same airfare out out of ei... either airport 
it's 98 round trip 
it's going to be 98 for round trip 
 there are lower fares into Los Angeles 
those are 78 round trip 
i guess 98's ok then 
you have to have at least a 7 day advance purchase 
and that's today's the last day to buy it for the 28th
and it would have gone up to 1 18 
and then it would have gone up to uh 1 48 one way 
they have a 98 one way and then a 148 one way 
so it jumps up pretty high 
the time on Friday that i'd like to depart would be evening 
if you could leave at like 1 in the morning 
i could get you a low airfare 
they only have one flight a day 
and i'll tell you what
going out isn't bad 
it's coming back that's bad 
they have fare of 68 round trip 
it's a 9 p m 
it's 1:05 in the morning 
you want to do that 
today's the deadline for for buying that ticket 
you were saying that it leaves on Friday 
it's a 1:05 in the morning 
it is available on Tuesday morning at 1:05 in the morning 
you want to book that 
that sounds just perfect actually 
the departure time is 9 o'clock on Friday 
that's it
that's all they have 
that's why their fare is lower then everyone else's 
they only have 
they don't have any competition  
they have one flight 
it's Continental 8 2 4 on the 28th of July 
this ticket is non-refundable non-changeable
and today is the deadline for ticketing 
this is B C calling from WWW 
and it's for which trip 
the trip that i'm supposed to take tomorrow night 
i'll pull that one up 
here's the problem 
i just learned today that i'm going to have to go to Richmond on Friday 
i have to be in Richmond on Friday
we keep the San Francisco to Newark tomorrow night 
the the number 
the August 1st 10:30  
the question is how can i get can i get to Ne... Newark to Richmond either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning early 
i don't have to be there until about 10 o'clock 
there's
there is a Piedmont flight which is non-stop from Newark to Richmond leaving at 4:05 in the afternoon on a Thursday 
or if you wanted to go in the morning of the 4th 
the only 
there's no 
it would be at 9:30 
you would not get in until 10:41 
there is one at what time on Thursday afternoon 
there's a later non-stop at 9 
and there are probably connections 
there's a
there's a United flight that leaves at 6:20 
that's going to be sold out um 
there's a 7:55 Piedmont that goes through Baltimore as a connecting city and gets into Richmond at 10:29 
cos we're flying together on the 4 o'clock Newark 
if we have to stay later
we'll juggle it at that end 
and then we need a hotel to stay in in Richmond 
i think he's going to 
i better let E do his own 
but that's what i think he's going to do 
because i think he's going to fly back up to New York and come back on his regularly scheduled return on Saturday 
i'm working within uh within your 
i'll have E call
because he may want to make some adjustments 
 it's B C down to Richmond on Thursday afternoon 
to return to either San Jose or San Francisco San Jose is preferable only because i live down in that direction 
then everything would be a connecting flight either to San Francisco or to San Jose 
the only problem is frequency of flights into San Jose  
i do like American
and i know one could presumably maybe go Richmond to Raleigh Durham 
or there's a Richmond to Dallas 
there's a flight offered
but it's at 12:23 p m 
the next flight after that is at 5:07 
it's a United changing planes in Chicago and getting in at 9:30 into San Jose 
the next American's at 5:30 
and it's a change of planes in Dallas and into 
that's just American 
that's just um other than United at 5:07 through Chicago
that was United 
there is a Piedmont flight at 1:35 through Charlotte North Carolina 
it would have to go 
you would have to go into San Francisco though in order to take that 
but that's about the right time i mean uh 
it's it's whatever is going to get me there 
bu... but the time seems to be about right
the 1:30 Piedmont 
it's Piedmont 
it goes to Charlotte North Carolina as a connection city 
and then you go into San Francisco 
and arrival time at San Francisco's at 6:37 
that seems about the right time 
then the round trip fare is 11 62 
that's the total round trip price 
and what we'll do is reissue um for the brand new fare 
you don't
i don't need that 
but what i do need is 
i suddenly recall that i'm going to back you up 
and i apologize for this too 
there is no lodging 
and what i would like to do is to get a room at the Marriot in Newark Airport 
i'm BB CC 
EE FF would like to book those tickets for th... coming in this Thursday 
we didn't need a TA 
that was somebody else 
he's going on personal travel 
i thought we needed a travel advance from you 
and i'm still 
it's been a busy 
this is C D 
i'd like to make some reservations please 
i don't know 
i've two passengers 
i don't have a profile for F 
i have that information here 
that's 
and the charge number 
i have two of them 
i need H first 
i don't need his yet 
i can only do one th... one profile at a time 
we do a generic profile
and i have to implement all this first 
then i can go into another area and do the other person 
the only way we'll start a permanent profile 
a form has to be filled out and completed by him and signed 
and that'll come back to us 
and then it's put in the computer 
they have'em at the travel office 
once he departs 
we have a profile for G 
we do 
and the same charge number for him 
his travel advance is 
and they're travelling to what city 
i'm sorry
i don't know that there is anything available 
the ideal would be from uh San Jose to uh Long Beach 
but i have a feeling that fli... a flight won't be available direct 
a... a... and this is for the morning 
there's a United at 8:55 
it'd have to be at 7 o'clock 
that would be San Francisco 
if it can't be San J...
it can't either 
the service out of San Francisco is 8:45 
i can get them San Jose LAX at 7 
that's hard to say 
maybe SFO's fine 
i have a feeling we're in Menlo Park
and i think they each live fairly close to here 
so probably SFO is better actually 
there is a United US Air or American at 7 
i think we had better price rates on the US Air didn't we 
they're going to be exactly the same 
i'm going to offer you what the lowest fare is 
it's not going to be on either of those carriers 
the lowest airfare would be on Pan Am at 6 a m 
their airfare is 59 dollars 
everyone else is 95 dollars 
that's a little cruel 
they they have to be in LA at 9:30 and so 
i think we'll stick with US Air number i think 2 9 0 8
it goes down 
only because we're having a lot of seat problems 
i... if i'm going to try and get them seats together 
we're having a lot of problems on the US Air seat maps 
so i i'm probably not going to be able to 
i don't know if i can get them together 
because we we request through our computer specific seats 
but we're not always getting them 
whatever we request pretty much we get 
it's up to you 
i i'll just you know book the US Air
i don't think i'll get to seat them together on that 
i don't know if they care if they sit together 
i feel like flipping a coin now 
it's real frustrating
i was 
the US Air flight was recommended by the manager 
i don't know if that makes 
he travels a lot 
he may of said it because of some preference 
i think they give really good service 
it's just that 
they give really good service 
they're just 
they have seats that we you know we can't book the the way you look 
when you look at your map 
you have no idea what they are 
so when you request them 
you don't get responses at all on them for 
 we won't know if it's 
i'm i'm going to do that 
what i have to do is like a generic request instead of asking for specific seats 
i can see what seats are available 
but then they don't tell us which ones we can't 
some of them are blo... blacked out for restrictions or like 
and we can't really tell on those 
i know that they said it's a real problem for themselves even their own agents trying to do their own seat assignments 
that's US Air 2 9 0 8 
and the return would be i believe US Air 2 7 7 7 
what d... 
you said 7 p m 
that'd be US Air 2 5 1 4 on the on the 10th 
they've changed their flight number 
th... that's wrong 
it's acting very strange 
that's US Air 2 7 7 7 on the 10th 
it's what's in his profile
that's on the profile 
from what these travellers are telling me 
there's only like a dollar difference between compact and midsized 
so i guess that's why they they 
the airfare again like i said is um 198 total 
that's 99 a person 
it's 1 98 each way on the airline 
and i guess 
i gotta offer what the lowest fares are 
so i have to see what the lowest fares returning are too 
the lowest airfare being declined is 59 each way on Pan Am 
which again is too early 
maybe that's why it's so cheap 
we just have 
we just have to offer it and notate that it was declined 
1 18 will be what's declined 
1 99 is what's being paid 
and the other passenger wants what kind of seating 
he would like a non-smoking window 
and these tickets will be sent over today 
i need u... wh... 
we've gotten the car in uh in at LAX from wh... wh... what rental agency 
that's Hertz 
and um i need one more thing 
i believe there's a limo that goes directly by WWW 
and he's only about a block from there
there's there's the WWW 
the um Airport Connection has a 13 dollar 
it's 13 dollars
and they have a pickup right at WWW 
if he takes a limousine 
it's 29 each way 
i think i'll go ahead and commit him to that 
i don't think he wanted to to spend 29 each way to be committed to it 
i'm not there 
but um  
if he walks or what 
i'm just wondering how far he really is from c... from our site 
i know where you're at 
he's at the 
i know where 
i'm trying to think
he's in Palo Alto 
i didn't know that 
i think he really is pretty close 
but uh i am committing him to making it into WWW by like 6 in the morning or something 
they are 10 minutes to the hour 
so it would have to be 6:50 
it can't be 6:50 
it'd have to be like 5:50 
they might have a six 
they have like a 6:15 
that would get him there like a quarter to 7 
but i don't know if that's like going to be enough time to check in 
he won't have any luggage 
and i'll put him on the best one we can 
that may not be appropriate 
i don't want him to both have to walk all walk over to WWW and  
if the timing works for that 
then i think that'd be appropriate 
otherwise i think we should get the limo 
you mean at 6:15 
if they have one at 6:15 
he'll take that one 
the... they're not going to be at 6:30 
cos it takes them about a half hour to get to the airport 
he wouldn't make his flight 
it's probably 
i think it's like 10 to si... 10 to 6 or then 
i think they then have another one at 
i'm not sure if they're just 10 minutes to the hour 
it would be 10 to 6 and that 
cos i'm not a traveller
there  
if he he he should at least arrive 20 minutes before the flight 
they can sell his seat to someone else 
so that's the problem 
so he should he should be leaving here at 6 o'clock then it seems like 
he he would get there about 6:30 right 
they leave 
if he's disembarking from the van at at 6:30 
then he's  
if he takes the limousine 
they're going to pick him up an hour and a half prior to departure 
cos he's not going to be the only person in that limousine 
the... they're going to go around and make pick ups 
and then they're they're probably going to say 5:30 they're going to pick him up 
if it if it if it comes 
if there is one
you are you saying there definitely is one at 10 to 6 
there is one definitly 10 to 6 
i'm not certain whether they have them like after 10 minutes after the hour 
i know they have them 10 minutes to the hour 
i think the 10 to 6 would be the most appropriate one 
that is round trip 
i i'll go ahead and book that 
then that'll also be printed on his itinerary 
i think building A 
it's building A is where they pick up 
it's Airport Connection 
that's it 
i i'm with WWW 
and um i've i've made a couple of bookings um with Holiday Inn on the on the on the free phone line 
i just wondered
they said to me you know we're government contractor 
and you made the reservation for me for for the last week 
they said bring some sort of government number 
i think as long as you've got your WWW id 
that's enough 
you think that's that's all it takes 
that is that should be all it takes 
because they are uh they honor it for all WWW employees normally 
a lot of people ask us for government rates at specific hotels or airlines or  
and you have to have some type of government badge or government id 
WWW's got a negotiated rate 
all you really need to show  
i you know i got a confirmation number from them 
i i i live in London England 
i'd quite like to get something in in writing
if it's you made it directly with them 
if i gave you the confirmation number
i could print up an order for them
i could 
what i could do is s... sell it as a book direct segment 
and i could print out an itinerary for you 
and that would have the the address and phone number and all that kind of stuff about the hotel plus the confirmation number 
i i'd appreciate that 
it's 
and um that was the Holiday Inn in Palo Alto 
it was the Holiday Inn in Boston 
that's the Boston Government Center it's called 
i've got that 
i'll send that address in 
that's the one on Blossom Street 
i would need to know the date you're checking in and the date you're checking out 
i'm checking in on the 31st of July late 
and it's uh it's a room with 3 beds actually 
they told me 86 dollars plus tax 
and and then there's some some more coming up 
and it's the North Burigan New Jersey Hotel
they call it North Burigan 
that was 
i think it's called the Holiday Inn Lincoln Tunnel if i'm not mistaken
and that's on um Canal Avenue 
i'm just jotting this down for further reference 
and that was for checking in on the 7th 
it's for 2 nights 
i'm 
and that was 77 dollars plus tax 
and there i only need a double room 
i made that 
and the confirmation number for that 
it's the same number  
i was just going to send you an itinerary with the  
whose extension should i have them call to um come pick up the itinerary 
normally we've got a an office over at WWW that we generate all our tickets and itineraries through 
and then the person our employee there will call call you and and just tell you that it's ready to come down and and pick it up 
cos i'm i'm only visiting here um 
i'll give you 
we'll um have them call her when the itinerary is all ready to be picked up 
i had an... one other question 
there's a flight on on a Tuesday in August 
there's a 9:40 flight 
it leaves at 9:40 out of Boston 
arrival in Nantucket is at 10:17 a m 
and then there's the flight from Nantucket back to Boston on Friday 
if you could give me the same details about that flight number and uh 
that's Delta flight 38 17 
this is for B C's trip 
and this is for his trip on uh September September to uh Frankfurt Germany 
she said it had to be ticketed today for the 100 1124 dollar flight 
and he still is wait-listed for that Lufthansa flight 
she said that if we don't ticket 
if we do ticket the 1 1 2 4 today 
and the... then we have to cancel that first fare 
there's a 100 dollar fine 
plus uh we pay for the going rate 
if ther... if it's going to be a higher rate 
it's going to be a higher rate 
if we wait and the Lufthansa flight does come up 
i don't know
we can't predict what a fare is going to be
if a fare if the computer's telling us that it's going to go higher 
we really can't tell you what it's going to go up to 
it doesn't tell us what it's going to be tomorrow 
all 
possibly that would help me out a little bit 
i'm trying to see if that's the one 
it looks like that might be the one that's holding whatever penalty 
it's from Saint Louis right 
that's the one that's holding the the 100 dollar penalty 
she told me that 
it says ticket may be issued on or after 
that looks like that's what it's um that's what it's holding is that 
but i don't know what um
he's coming back on Lufthansa 
i see that
i was wondering
since we had uh we wait-listed on the Lufthansa 
when it does list 
when they list it there 
it is available 
why can't he get that 11 24 whatever round trip 
or it was maybe like 11 30 or something 
you mean if the if the the uh wait list clears 
we don't have any guarantee that it will clear 
i really don't know what uh what to tell you 
i think that'll 
i think the best thing to do is just ta... ge... go one way on that other one to guarantee his flight 
this is B over in Dr C's office 
and we need to get an estimate on how much uh for a round trip ticket to Little Rock Arkansas 
he would like to leave um possibly the afternoon of the 28th of October 
basic fare quote um prices can range anywhere from a full coach fare of what 1070 round trip  
it all depends on what's available at the time of his booking and if he's going to be staying over a Saturday night and if he's going to purchase the tickets at least 14 days prior to his departure and willing to take a penalty fare 
he will be leaving uh returning actually on the the Thursday after 
so he would be staying over a Saturday night 
if he's leaving on the 28th 
that is a Saturday  
that would qualify him as long as he purchased the tickets 14 days prior to that departure date 
so he would have to um have reservations made and ticketed by the 13th of uh October 
again this is provided that the flights are available 
when he calls to make the reservation 
we can get him on a non-refundable fare for you know a fairly good price compared to 1070 
1070 is completely non-penalty 
and that is the lowest no-penalty available in that market 
it's non-penalty
and the non-refundable is uh 14 days prior to departure and provided that the flights are available 
and it's um
that can be as low as um 358 and also 318 
there's one 
it depends on what you know day of the week we're looking at 
if he's gonna travel on a Saturday 
358 would apply 
if he were travelling midweek still staying over a Saturday night 
there's the 318 fare 
then the fare could range anywhere even higher than that 378 for a 25 percent penalty fare travelling mid-week 
that's based on a 7 day advanced purchase or 418 round trip also 25 percent penalty 
and that would be pretty much the uh the breakdown 
the 418 is the highest for the for the discounted 
the highest for the lowest 
and then it would jump from there to the full coach non-penalty for 1070 
i could tell him a ra... p... pretty much a range between 3 25 to 4 18 depending on the discount 
and the time 
but if he wants to go with the lowest no-penalty coach
he's gotta pay 
the full coach 
they don't offer unfortunately any discounts without penalties for that market 
i'll let him know that 
this is B B 
i need to make some travel arrangements 
i believe there's one leaving at 11 o'clock in the morning 
that's United flight 4 7 0 
that's the one 
i believe there's one at 5:16 
that's United flight 6 5 0 9 
it arrives back into San Jose at 6:42 
the best fare i can get you on this would be 568 round trip 
that does have a 25 percent change cancellation penalty on it 
and we'd have to ticket it by Tuesday 
this is B C 
Doctor D spelled D like in 
and he needs to leave early in the morning 
and he doesn't know a flight number or a time 
he's going from San Francisco to Tampa's um Saint Pete's 
Delta has a flight at 7:05 a m 
that connects through Dallas 
that would get him in to Tampa at 4:35 p m 
and they have another flight at 8:25 a m that connects through Atlanta which would get in at 6:10 
never mind then 
cos we're looking for the cheapest way 
that's a Sunday 
and he said around 6 p m 
i'll take just a second longer 
you said by the lowest fare available you 
we are talking like a non-refundable fare correct 
that would be uh something in the range of 400 to 410 round trip 
i want to ask you something else 
i'd have to keep him for that kind of fare 
i would have to keep him on the same fl... airline coming back as i sent him out on 
there are later flights
he got some information from this conference he's going to 
and they have said that uh they they recommended somebody down in Saint Petersburg Beach 
normally the conference rates do offer some discount like that 
but it's not as usually as good as taking the uh the penalty fare 
60 percent of that would be 
and it i they also included here a Delta file code number 
we we can use that if you want to go ahead for the conference rate 
we can 
i i would need that code number to apply for that conference rate 
but then that's 200 dollars more than this non-refundable 
it is true 
there is no penalty attached to the conference rate 
whereas th... this non-refundable is non-refundable 
but if it's 
it is 200 dollars more 
if he can uh go with the penalty 
he's going to come out ahead with the um the non-conference rate 
but i could i could still give you this Delta file code number and and i could do it through you instead of having to deal with these people down in Saint Petersburg Beach 
that is correct 
i'm going to throw this past him 
and i'll get back to you later today 
cos we've got um 
this is like the 11th 
i've just got quite a few trips here 
he wants to change um United to U US Air 
and and he wanted to go similar times 
we can put him on US Air 2 9 5 4 
98 dollars would be the lowest confirm... confirmable fare 
and that is a non-penalty fare as well 
that's today 
i'm supposed to get an aisle seat for him for both flights 
i'm requesting 8 C on the outbound flight 
those are both aisles 
and 
it's going to be 
because we do not 
then we're not missing that in the profile at least 
and we'll get him 
his car is uh confirmed for intermediate car 
this is B again 
and i talked to C 
he made me feel like there had to be some other options besides going through Heathrow 
there 
there has to be some other options 
what i do is i ask for connections er flights from Hong Kong to Moscow 
and that's what it's giving me as available connections 
and that's what i'm getting is through Heathrow 
i... 
there has to be other options doesn't 
i see what you mean 
and also there has to be some other airlines too uh that are flying into Moscow besides 
you only gave me 
there are other 
what i 
this is 
what you did was you gave me 
we've got the first thing that that comes up is that 9:30 pm flight 
there is another option that we wouldn't 
if it was sold out
it would show it to me 
that's what i was wondering 
the only other option i have would be a Cathay Pacific flight 
it arrives into London to Gatwick airport at 4 at 5:50 5:40 
and then he'd connect to a British Air flight out of London Heathrow airport 
he'd be going into Gatwick and leaving out of Heathrow 
i know
i i indicated i said the only 
he says 
i i don't know
and al... also he said there has to be other airlines
and i he mentioned a couple
i i remembered a couple
this is what when i ask for for Hong Kong 
thi... that's what i'm trying to explain 
we could try building our own connection 
when i ask Hong Kong Soviet Union
that's what it's giving me 
perhaps we can build our own like you say 
that's maybe that's what he's talking about 
if he wants to go for like a three point connection 
there are three point connections available 
so he can make a decision 
there's a 
maybe that's what he's trying to say 
un... unless you can find a three point by going to Moscow 
i can 
what i'm saying is that uh 
that's the next availability that's coming up 
and that would be a flight that leaves at 6 p m from Hong Kong 
and then he would take another flight to Heathrow 
i've got that down as an option 
otherwise there's um more through Bangkok 
there's different carriers Bangkok to Heathrow to Moscow 
there's one Hong Kong to Tokyo to London to Moscow 
everything's going to end up London Moscow 
it's just a matter of 
you mean departing from Helsinki to uh or Hong Kong 
you always have to go
you can't go straight through Hong Kong to 
that would 
we'd have to build our own connection 
that would be where we'd have to ask for 
we would force 
that's called forcing a connection 
i can ask for um flights through Helsinki 
it's not going to come out 
cos that's 
i wanted to know how much it would be for a one way ticket to Las Vegas 
the 13th of June 
and that's a Friday 
i'd like to find out the one the one way and the round trip
the lowest one way fare out of San Francisco would be on United at 2 o... 205 dollars one way 
that's with a 25 percent penalty 
it's pretty expensive i think 
it's a little better out of San Jose 
the lowest one way fare out of San Jose is pricing out at 165 dollars 
there's it it's cheaper actually if 
it's almost the same price if you go round trip 
for instance i can get you a 158 dollar 25 percent penalty round trip fare out of San Jose 
and San Jose is a little better market for going into Las Vegas than San Francisco is 
i've got departures now 
the fares are looking a little more sold out than than what i was quoting you 
the best one for farewise would be a America West flight at 2:10 p m 
it would be on the the 5th 
the 5th of July 
the 4th
the 4th 
the very best fare i can get you is 138 dollars uh on... round trip
and that is a non-refundable fare 
that's leaving on the 13th at 2:10  p m on America West 
if i bring you back at 4:35 p m on America West 
i can get you uh a still a non-refundable fare 
but it would be 153 dollars round trip 
the 138's good 
we have you on Amer... confirmed on America West flight 8 0 8 
and this is 
the fare on this is 138 dollars 
it you do have y... you have to ticket this in order for this reservation to remain intact 
i can do it right now actually uh 
you're welcome 
this is A
i have a question 
if the 6:20 flight was available 
i've got 
it still shows available if you want to book it 
i assume it's the same as the other one 
it's flight 6 4 0 
my name is B C 
and i would like to plan a trip 
and the date you need to leave 
i have to work a little bit backwards here 
i want to leave on the first flight out of ORD 
the eighth 
and i want to take whatever red eye or any other flight that i have to take to get there in time to make that transfer 
the first 
i need to catch the first flight from ORD out to Greenbay Wisconsin uh Monday morning 
it looks like the first one is a 7:40 on American uh Eagle 
that arrives Greenbay at 8:51 
i do show space avaliable 
i don't know if there are any red eyes from there 
there is one on United that leaves Oakland at 11:30 p m and arrives Chicago 5:25 a m 
so that's a two-hour hold there  
it's about the same 
American has an 11:41 flight from San Francisco that arrives Chicago 5:54 
so that's that's a a wash 
that sounds good 
i don't know if you prefer United over American or 
i'm a member of the United Travel 
will leave SFO at 
you'd be on United flight 5 2 0 8 
and then you would connect with American flight 4 2 0 8 
that's actually operated by American Eagle 
the flight number 
and i need a flight uh let's see i guess mid to late morning back uh 
that's that's probably going to be via Chicago 
United has a 9:47 connection through Chicago 
and you would conn... connect with an American flight that would arrive Springfield 12:31 
or you can take American both legs 
it's only 9:37 to 12:30 
that sounds good to me 
that would be United flight 2 9 7 4 
that flight is operated by United Express Air Wisconsin 
and it leaves Greenbay 9:37 a m 
again that's operated by American Eagle 
that's good 
and then you're going to return from Chicago on the fourteen or 
United has a 3:45 non-stop that arrives San Francisco 6:03 
or they have a five p m that arrives 7:18 
there's a 2:50 on American that arrives San Francisco 5:25 or a 1 o'clock on United that arrives San Francisco 3:14 
i think i'm going to do the 1 p m thing 
that would be United 
i want to pull a map 
i want 
i think it's either two or three hundred miles that i have to drive if i'm going to come into ORD 
it's a different town 
but it's very very close to that 
i've got my auto club map 
if you have
that's probably better
it would give you the 
i've got about 250 miles 
that's 5 hours of driving 
i want to book the um i want to book the 3 what is it 3 p m or so United flight out of Chicago 
that would be United f... 
it leaves at 3:45 
and it leaves at 3 
you want me to price this and see what we get for the lowest available fare 
this is two weeks in advance 
so it should be 
and you are staying over a Saturday night 
so we should be able to do something here 
it's taking a moment 
i can send your United number to Hertz 
i'm just looking at this fare we got back 
the lowest available would be 600 and 60 dollars round trip 
that is completely non-refundable 
and the last day to issue the ticket would be today because it has a fourteen day advance purchase 
that is that is the discounted fare then 
and that's that's the the lowest 
we would have to issue the ticket today 
and it would be completely non-refundable  
and if you want to go with that 
or we could look at er er portions of your trip going to change 
it won't change 
i've i've 
you mean 
i uh wanted to check to see if it was possible to reput me back on that 2 2 9 flight 
i'm showing that flight as being sold out completely 
i would like to get uh some fare information 
this is um a round trip from San Francisco to Stockholm 
and basically what i want to know is the what the business class and the first class fares are 
it would probably be uh leaving on June 17th 
i have i have eh no preference 
we're basically 
the issue is that uh the client's asking us to travel on our own time on weekends 
and we're thinking about whether we should ask them to pay for first class travel 
we've got 
it depends on what eh if you want to look at like j... a coach fare on a round trip basis 
it's not 
we're not even considering coach 
you just want first class 
we're going 
and then i don't know if you even want to hear the coach round trip 
that's interesting 
that's all i needed to know 
this is C with American Express 
i called to make arrangements for a trip to Vancouver 
this is a new reservation here 
it's a new reservation 
i was a little confused there 
you said on the 8th of August 
the 9th 
and this is from San Francisco 
there's a Delta non-stop at 7:40 a m 
that gets in at 9:40 
the next non-stop is going to be 
the next non-stop is sold out 
the one second Canadian Air 
n... n... that's too late 
that Delta flight looks the best 
that's Delta flight 
what and when again 
one will be coming back uh direct
and the other option will be leaving a little earlier 
the 2 no-stops are on Canadian Airlines 
they are at 1:40 p m and 8 p m 
or one stop maybe in either Portland or Seattle and continuing on down 
there'd be a 4:40 departure uh on Alaskan Air 
it connects up with a United flight at 6:30 
if i stop over Seattle
i'll want a few hours 
so what i'll want to do is um probably not leave Seattle until about 8:30 or so 
that's one
the other thing is 
i'll look at uh moving that up a bit  
there's a 4:38 on United 
there's um a like 
i could get you on a 4:38 United out of Vancouver 
it's into Seattle at 5:25 
i see a 7:45 p m departure on United 
7:50 is the last flight out 
7:50 is the last anybody has out of  
i thought i'd been there later than that 
you said at the moment you've got a a 4:38 United out of Vancouver 5:25 into Seattle 
and i guess a couple of United connections 
but the latest is 7:45 
if i took 
the normal connection would be a 5:55 departure 
i'll take that 4:38 United 5 2 5 
we've got you then on United flight 1 1 5  7 on the 10th of August 
i grabbed the wrong flight 
that's United 
the last United flight and almost one of the last direct flights is 7:45 
that flight number is United flight 1 0 8 9 
i'm up on Delta as a non-stop at 7:40 
and i'm back on United at uh 4:38 the next day 
the fare on this is 376 70 
and i do need to advise you 
you do need to bring proof of U... United States citizenship 
it's A with American Express Travel 
i need to make some reservations for two people 
it is 
we don't have a profile for him 
he must uh 
he's travelled before 
but he is not one of the regulars 
so that might be 
he hasn't he hasn't filled out the form probably in any case 
they're available in the travel office if he does want to fill one out 
i need his employee number please 
and the charge number for the trip 
he's going to go San Francisco to Newark 
and he would like to arrive in Newark around 6 o'clock at night 
and he would request an United flight 
the closest thing i have to arriving at that time would be a flight leaving at 8:20 from San Francisco 
arrival time in Newark would be 4:43 
United would have a flight arriving at 8:51 
that sounds just fine 
the 8:20 flight 
the 8:20 a m 
and that would be non-stop 
we're just going to leave it with an open return 
so we're not going to make a resevation 
or you want me to ticket something with an open ticket 
all he has to do when he gets back to Newark is to have them plunk in a number 
it could be anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks 
we just have to put in um a um a fake fake date in there so it reads it 
it's 1076 is the lowest fare that we could confirm 
it's a non-penalty fare of course 
i think the last time the guy told him it was almost 12 hundred 
that's uh that's fairly uh fairly low in fact 
the outbound flight is pricing at a discounted fare without um without any penalty 
so that's probably why it's so 
i think 
and i'll get hold of him 
that's no problem 
and we have to do one more 
and they don't need a car either 
that's not a 
i'm just confirming his fare right now 
and then we'll go to the next one 
he's one of our machinists 
so i know you don't have a profile on him 
and it's going to be the same 
the same itinerary 
he has asked if it wouldn't be any problem if he can have a Newark to Los Angeles open return 
i'll go ahead and issue that 
that round trip um so to speak round trip with open return is 1055 
so it's lower to go to LA i guess 
and that's again non-penalty 
and everything is confirmed for that 
i will call him right now 
it's a good thing i checked with him 
he has changed his plans 
open return 
he thinks a smoking window would be great 
i'll go ahead 
and CCC DDD  
there's no windows in n... smoking available 
i could put them in one seat in front of the other 
or i could put them in uh two aisles with a middle seat between them in the central section of the p... of the flight 
cos the the two seats
and there are three seats in the center of the plane and then two seats again 
i could put them both on an aisle seat 
and there'd be a middle seat that's empty between them right now 
this is tough isn't it 
there's unfortunately there are no um aisles across from each other this way 
they would just have be in the middle section there 
i can't guarantee that no one will be sitting between them 
but middle seats are usually the last last seats to be assigned 
one will 
i'll do that 
then i'll put them in 30 C and 30 or er 30 D 
everything's set 
and um NNN will give you a call on Monday when they're both uh ready to be picked up 
we have an emergency traveller who is going t... uh Copenhagen from San Francisco to Los Angeles 
and he is going on a 2 o'clock flight 
he's going to Copenhagen today 
it's just a flat one way 
we should be able to do it 
he would like to be on United flight 1 1 1 7 
he's going all the way through to Copenhagen 
and this is a connection in what city 
it's eh going out at uh 2 o'clock today 
and you said
the 1 1 1 7 i'm showing sold out 
we can put him
there are other flights 
there i can get a seat on it 
but i can get it 
if he can go business class
they're allowed it for flights over 
and this is just going to be one way only right 
i have him on United flight 1 1 1 7 on today Friday the 26th out of San Francisco at 2 p m 
it arrives Copenhagen at 1:05 p m on the 27th of May 
that's wonderf... 
and that's already confirmed
so that's 
and i am wondering now if we can we add another leg to that uh 
we would like on Monday
and that would be uh SAS flight 2 9 1
and that is a 10:30 a m departure 
so if we do that
i'm going to have to send it off to the airlines for faring 
and i can't guarantee how fast they'll come back with a fare 
i understand 
and you did make the reservation for the uh Monday 5 2 0 9 flight 
i haven't confirmed it yet
but i've just got it  
that's that's confirmed now 
we'll just ticket as far as Copenhagen
and he'll deal with the rest in Denmark then 
if it's not back within an hour
we'll just ticket him as far as Copenhagen 
this is A with American Express returning your call 
i need to know some prices uh to compare against subcontract 
i need to go in from San Francisco to Wild Wood New Jersey and return 
that's near Atlantic City 
we don't have commercial flights going into Wild Wood Cape May 
what would be the closest would be Atlantic City 
i need a full coach 
full coach would be 586 each direction 
next one is simple from  
again full coach would be 531 dollars each direction 
you got me exactly where it is 
it's Tok Alaska 
it's in the same time zone as Juno's in 
it's 208 miles southeast of Fairbanks 
so i guess what we've got to do is uh figure into Fairbanks 
now you know 
i 
but i mean it's on this in this atlas 
and em 208 miles southeast of Fairbanks puts it right in the middle of nowhere 
Fairbanks would be the closest for it 
that's about where it belongs
that does 
that sounds more like it 
you're quite welcome 
this is C 
i need to make some um uh travel arrangements please 
it's DDD D D D 
he needs to go on Tuesday May 9th 
that's the 1:30 to 9:39 non-stop 
i've got that for him 
he needs to figure that out 
if we could 
he's got um 
as long as he's got a slot on that flight 
we're okay 
we should know sometime this afternoon 
if you want to give me a call back 
will do 
this is B C WWW 
and this is for personal travel 
i actually am going to i think be buying a ticket for someone else 
and so i need to know some time periods 
this p... this will be from Traver City Michigan to SFO 
the 28th of August 
and i'd like an open return 
but it would probably be something like the uh 19th of September 
if you have open return 
you're not going to get the lowest fare 
the lowest require a confirmed return 
cos they're all subject to what days you're travelling 
and they have to be confirmed
you would be paying as high as 
so you have to have a confirmed return to get the lowest fares 
and if it's confirmed 
i ne... i need to know the dates days 
the lowest airfare would be 353 round trip 
that's a non-refundable non-changeable ticket 
you have to make the reservation er buy the ticket within 20 hours after reservations are made 
the very latest you can make reservations and buy tickets would be 14 days uh before departure 
and that would be subject to the fares being available 
it's real restrictive too 
so once you buy it
they can't change anything on it 
you use it or lose it 
and there's nothing in between th... even with uh confirmed date that would allow for a cancellation at anytime before the 
the only fare that allows you that is the 5 24 
so if you have 
there's a 25 percent penalty ticket 
but you still have to use it round trip 
you'd have to make your re... changes 7 days before the new date or pay a 500 dollar fare to come home 
that's American or Northwest
the two carriers service that 
and and it's the same no matter if if we changed to United 
they're all the same 
they all are competitive with one another 
so the fares are the same 
so it's Northwest or American 
and it goes Traver City to Chicago O'Hare 
it depends on who you're using 
Northwest will go through Detroit 
and United will go through 
you can't use United 
they don't service Traver City 
so it would have to be American or Northwest 
and American goes through Chicago 
i guess i have some thinking to do and some questions to ask 
i just talked to C D 
you you mentioned that there was the American flight
and there was also a Un... United flight 
the United flight leaves at 5:40 and gets in at 10:11 
that goes through Denver 
that's American flight 6 2 7 on the 2nd of August 
i'm looking 
that's uh a DC 10 from Newark to Dallas and then a DC 9 from Dallas to to San Jose 
that is a DC 10 correct 
you're right 
because he's not going to be able to upgrade anyway 
he's not 
he's not
the fare does go up 
Continental's just a little cheaper market then American is 
and we'll go ahead and set that up for reticket 
i don't show that he has an American frequent flyer number in his in his profile here 
i ne... i need to um change that to United on the return 
and i have his United um mileage plus number 
we've got that number in the system here i believe 
we do not 
that fare will be 9 34 
and what we've got him on is United flight 2 8 1 
sometimes international takes a little bit longer for them to compute 
we've got uh 
i'm still waiting on the London to Brussels 
Air Europe has a flight round trip for 2 13 59 
British Air has a 174 14 round trip 
or the highest it could go would be 2 26 08 
that was it 
that's what i needed 
it's flight 9 2 7 on the 26th of July Dallas to Denver 
and the last name is C 
i want to see if i can get seats for him on those flights 
i'm BB CC from WWW 
i'd like to make some travel arrangements 
i'd made made some arrangements on Monday that have to be changed 
and they're g... and they were to go to 
it looks like we've got you going into Raleigh Durham 
i wanted to change the uh uh departure date from the 10th to the 16th 
since 
it would be nice to leave about 12 
the only thing i have leaving at noon would be a connection on Delta through Atlanta 
it would get in at 9:50 p_m 
and what else needed to be changed then 
how long 
we don't need to make reservations in the hotel 
they'll take care of that 
i'll need the Hertz car 
and i i i have to make plans to stay through the week 
so i'd be leaving on Friday 
Friday's going to be the 21 
i've got a Piedmont flight that leaves at 5:55 
it's a change of planes in Charlotte North Carolina 
there's also a US Air flight at 6:20 
arrival is at 10:30 
the cheaper of the two would be fine 
and that comes out to a fare of 916 
if that's going to make a difference 
they're both going to come out to the same fare 
so you've got a choice of going through Charlotte North Carolina at 5:55 
i'll take the Piedmont flight 
that would be a total of 916 round trip for the lowest fare 
and that would involve a 25 percent penalty for making any changes or refunds 
i think that's probably not a good idea 
the non-lowest non-penalty fare in that case would be 1010 
we'll go with that 
and you still want to go with the compact car 
and i'm just confirming that for you right now 
that's all confirmed 
and we're all set to go with that 
since i'm leaving on Sunday 
then you're all set and non-penalty fare 
i'd prefer that 
it looks like we're not having any luck with um ou... the Delta flight on the 16 the July from San Francisco to Atlanta 
the only thing i could confirm would be a middle seat 
i could get you 
the only thing i could get would be like an aisle in smoking 
i really prefer to go the middle seat non-smoking 
at least that is a bulkhead seat 
arrival in Atlanta is at 7:35 p_m 
and that's going to depart at 5:55 and arrive Charlotte 6:38 
where you would connect to Piedmont flight 1 2 6 7 
and that's departing at 7:35 from Charlotte 
i was able to get you a window seat in non smoking 
we can't look at their seat maps 
i can't tell you exactly what seat numbers we are confirming 
but i will request non smoking windows 
i have a travel for uh scheduled leaving leaving on Monday 
and i need to make a change 
i've got it 
the 26th 
and there's a United flight 9 2 7 
it leaves 6:40 to Dallas 
now that we've got all that
it would have to be on Am... on United 
i prefer that 
i'll do it that way 
it looks like it would be slightly cheaper out of Oakland 
but you would have to connect going to Dallas 
there's no non-stops 
there's a 2:25 connection through Denver that gets into Dallas at like 9:30 around 9:30 in the evening 
you could take the same 6:40 flight 
it just connects to another flight to Oakland rather then to San Francisco 
it's at 9:59 
what i really need to do is check with my wife to see if she can pick me up 
and if if i need to change
i'll get back to you as soon as i can 
because you sh... should have a new ticket 
i already have and everything in Chicago 
i i had 
i don't believe so 
i think it's just different fares 
Oakland has slightly different fares to Dallas than 
it turns out there's an earlier United flight a 3:40 
it leaves at 3:43 
that is a one-stop flight
it stops in Denver 
i don't think i can make it to that one 
and and and i will call back to confirm 
i won't ticket without your approval on it 
i need some round trip air fares 
and this is just for a quote 
and all departing from San Francisco 
that would be 4 88 each direction 
that is 5 96 each direction 
that would be 2 95 each direction 
and we are talking Columbus Ohio correct 
you got a lot of projects going 
and the last one is Oklahoma City 
and that's 4 0 2 each direction 
i'd like to make a travel arrangement please 
i have to get a travel advance 
he's departing on June 14th
we have him on US Air flight 2 6 5 0 on the 14th of June
he's returning on the 16 of June on US Air flight 2 6 6 5 
and the fare on this is a 198 dollars
i think we'd like to pay just with the full fare
because he could change his mind 
this is full fare
there is no penalties or anything 
you'll have it on Monday 
i want to go to New York Monday morning 
i went there last Wednesday 
i see you flying on Pa... uh on Pan Am 
i don't have the complete history in front of me 
it's uh 5:45 Pan Am 
and this will be at the fare of 
it'll be 1060 dollars 
i guess that's it 
thank you 
i'm B with WWW 
and i'd like to make some travel arrangements 
this is um May 12th 
there's an eight o'clock i believe United flight 
that's 8 a m 
we have you confirmed on United flight 1 1 0 3 
that's on the 12th of May 
and the 
what happened to the 78 dollar fares or those sort of things 
those you need to stay over a Saturday night for 
i need some help trying to get from Seattle to uh San Francisco Monday night the 
my problem is that my family and i are leaving San Francisco on TWA at 8 o'clock in the morning 
you uh spoke with me earlier 
if you leave from Portland the evening before
the  
it wasn't any better 
it was worse 
and their earliest flight would have you arrive at 8:07 a m 
it's not not great 
so the only possiblity real remote one is 7:50 US Air flight huh 
or there was a 7:45 
i think there's a United at 7:45 
the US Air's at 7:50 
or there's a United at 7:45 
that gets in at 9:34 
they were both available 
the US Air's got less seats available than the United 
the United's wide open 
but the US Air um is selling out in the lower classes of service 
so there's st... still seats available 
but they're not quite as many as the United flight 
i'd like to make a couple of arrangements 
the traveller will be CCC DDD 
i think that 
i don't know if this is the same trip we're thinking of 
it sure is 
i've already made it with um EEE FFF
he 
so all i needed was the travel advance for him 
we've gone through 
it's American flight 1 4 0  4 
and that's departing at 6 p m from LA 
and they were confirmed at a fare of 1 98 
there were no penalties attached to that fare 
and the only thing that uh was a stumbling block in the reservations was the return seat on American flight 3 7 2 
we could only get middle seating for all 3 passengers 
and i advised Mr FFF of that 
and he said they would um look into it when they check in in San Jose
that's a good idea 
this will be exactly the duplicate for Mr HHH 
except that his um advance number is 
this is uh B 
i need to make some reservations 
i need to make uh reservations
and the date that we know we're booking is on what day 
it's Monday the 20th 
and that's flying to what city 
and i'd like first class if it's available 
i'm gonna use an upgrade coupon which is coming Federal Express tomorrow or Wednesday 
that's the 19th
that's on the 19th 
i thought Monday was the 20th 
it's uh a regular um mileage plus upgrade where you use the miles you've accumulated 
so it's good for booking first class 
all i have to do is give you the coupon
it's it's uh the number one priority type of uh 
it's round 
but if i only use it one way
it doesn't matter
it's a ro... round trip
i have to forfeit the rest of it 
that's uh United flight 12 on the 12th of June 
you said the 19th 
i put 20th 
that's all right 
Monday isn't the best time 
it isn't 
that's United flight 12 on the 19th of June 
i'm not i'm still making uh reservations or er appointments for the rest of the week 
so i'll have to get back to you on the return 
this is BB CC at WWW 
i need to go to from San Jose to Los Angeles on Friday the 14th of July 
this is business travel 
and you said that was on the 14th of July that you had to travel 
that would get you in at 8:11 
and it's flight 1 4 0 4 
and i would like to get uh aisle seats on those please 
i cannot get you a aisle on the return 
that's a busy day 
Friday's always bad 
the best i could do would be um a middle seat right now 
but that would be 
and we'll st... you know try to switch it before then if possible 
you can also 
when you check in in San Jose before you leave 
you can always make the switch then 
cos it is the day of the departure 
so if you've got a little extra time or something um 
and i will see if i can change it up until that point 
and i'd like a Hertz car 
there's three of us going to be going 
and i'm just waiting for a confirmation number on the car 
they're going to be two other people in a different uh org that are going to be taking the same flight 
and um their last names are EE 
so if you want to put them on for the same reservation 
i'll uh 
i have to make three separate 
i just want you to understand that 
that's kind of what 
i i uh they they'll want to get on the same uh flight that i do 
and they'll have to call you directly with the travel advance numbers and so forth 
they're in different buildings 
i can uh i can tentatively make their reservations if you like 
and then uh what we'll have to do is get their 
i'll i'll tell their secretary to give you a call 
i'll go ahead and um set them up for Wednesday the 12th 
you're all set 
this is A at American Express 
i need to know uh business class round trip uh fare for uh San Francisco to uh Baron Switzerland 
i'm checking a couple different carriers just to compare them before i give you the fare on this 
i seem to have a very slow computer here 
i have one fare 
and i'm just trying to see if i can verify it on another carrier 
the round trip would be that times 2 plus 13 for taxes 
it looks like approximately right 
i get 1589
it's it's in that ballpark 
there isn't any one carrier that flies all the way in there 
you need to connect somewhere like from TWA to Air France or Pan Am to Air France or something to get in to Baron 
and also you can't get business class all the way through 
but they fare it business class all the way 
you you you would get business class from the US to your European gateway city 
you would probably be in Coach 
this is A with American Express Travel 
i spoke to you about 20 minutes ago about uh Japan around the world 
i don't know if they offer 
i don't think they offer a Business uh Class around the world 
it has to be economy 
i found out um restrictions also 
San Francisco Tokyo uh fare quote for business round trip would be 2114 
and again the coach was 1714 
but there it is also offered for business 
and that's again the same of of applications of four stop overs uh for minimum maximum of 15 
and the purchase restrictions were 21 days in advance 
you get a full refund within 21 days of the flight 
it's 25 percent penalty um attached to all all of those fares economy business and first 
it is uh waivable the 25 percent 
it applies to any type of fare 
it costs more than i thought 
but the guy i'm going with will be flying business and i'll be sitting in the 
there is not an American flight 
there's an Alaska Air flight at 10:15 
it gets into Seattle at 12:15 
th... they would be returning on American Airlines number 2 2 5 
that was... that was a good time at 5:20 
the fare we were holding at was 258 
this would uh increase it by 40 dollars 
so it would be 
you said 2 98 exactly 
it would not 
it would be a 25 percent penalty for changes or refunds 
that's Alaska Airlines 
and and then we will go ahead and book for the American Airlines 
we'll keep that the same 
or or we're still waiting 
and i do have the travel advance 
i'm in 
i'm just checking on whose reservation i was in right now 
his number then is 
it's  
and i did give you a charge number on that didn't i 
you did 
that's stands the same 
and i think that's it 
the tickets would be ready for pickup 
these will be ready 
we can run them today now 
the 25 percent penalty fare
that will be valid throught the 20th of July 
if you wanted to wait 
it was just the non-refundable had to be issued within 24 hours 
it would have to be issued within 24 hours 
that was the one we were holding 
but this but the 2 89 is 25 percent penalty 
we do not have to issue it uh within twenty four hours 
you want to still go ahead and do it today 
but i mean it's no rush when when we we get it 
i was wondering if you could handle some some reservations for me 
i it's it's um for my own my own flight 
i want to fly from San Francisco to Syracuse New York 
and you want to travel ag... again on what day now 
it depends on on when the flights are 
i i i could leave late Friday after work 
and if that doesn't work out 
then i i could go the morning of the 9th of September 
we're going San Francisco to Syracuse 
it's just going to be a simple round trip 
and you want the lowest fare available 
that's that's really what i'm i'm after 
it's going to be wide open on all of them at th... this far in advance 
i don't
i know Delta airlines flies to Rochester 
but i don't think it goes to Syracuse 
i like Delta airlines 
i... it's American US Air i think are our 
they have a lot of flights too 
you're looking at something that's going to be uh after work on Friday 
the last flight out is going to be at 1:47 p m on TWA 
that will get you there the same day
that would get in at just about midnight 
it becomes red eye flights
i don't know if i want to want to to do a red eye 
we have flights starting at 6:15 a m 
that would get you there at 4 o'clock
and it's 6:15 a m 
then we have one at 6:40 a m which would get you there at 4:36 
that is US Air 
all of these are going to be connecting flights 
this particular one connects through Cleveland 
US Air flight has a flight at 7:55 a m 
it gets you back into San Francisco at 11:53 a m 
and that's through Pittsburg 
we're getting a fare here of 398 dollars round trip 
it is telling us that it has to be ticketed within 24 hours of making the reservation 
that means tomorrow 
if you want to keep this reservation 
we have you on US Air flight 1 1 6 
you're connecting there with US Air flight 5 9 3 
we have you returning on the 17th of September on US Air flight 5 0 7 
it is totally non-refundable 
i think we're all set right 
there is no BBB here 
the person 
you had not made a reservation for this person yet right 
that's personal
and you're going to pay for cash 
and it was from San Jose to L to LA you said 
that's the only uh flight i think 
and it was into LAX on Continental 
i don't show that Continental flies there from San Jose 
maybe she was looking out of San Francisco 
there's a flight out of San Francisco at 9 o'clock 
if that's the only place 
it's 49 dollars 
it's Continental flight 8 2 4 
and it was 
and that's um ge... leaving at 9 p m from San Francisco 
and the total 
and that's confirmed right 
that's confirmed right now 
and we'll get the tickets over to you as soon as possible 
there is delivery over to WWW 
we issue the tickets out of WWW 
so um we generate the tickets from here 
but it it comes out at WWW 
so i'll have someone call you as soon as they're ready to be picked up 
C is going to go to Ottawa 
what i need right now are um choices 
and he needs to be there in time for an evening meeting if he can be 
a... i assumed that 
there's nothing really that gets in that early 
Air Canada has a connection through Toronto that leaves San Francisco at 7:50 a m 
but the connection to Ottawa doesn't leave until 5:15 
that's about the earliest one 
we have one tha... on Air Canada that goes to Toronto huh 
and then it's a change of planes there 
but it doesn't arrive into Ottawa until 6:10 
i guess it's too 
the first one is Air Canada flight 7 5 0 8
the connection is flight 4 6 0
and it arrives Ottawa 
only if there's an overnight direct flight on Piedmont 
but it leaves leaves the night before at 11:40 p m 
i'm writing this down 
that's Piedmont what 
it really isn't worth considering 
it makes three 
it's direct in that it's the same plane all the way through
but 
there are no non-stop flights 
there's a CP Air f... uh connection through Vancouver 
it get's in later 
it leaves at 9:10 a m and arrives Vancouver 
it's a Canadian Airline like Air Canada
it's CP Air flight 1 4 0 
it's out of San Francisco at 9:10 a m 
it connects to CP Air flight 7 2 2 
that does make one stop between Vancouver and Ottawa 
we might
cos the time zone's in our v... our favor coming 
he said either l... late on the 23rd or or any time on the 24th 
by late he means something like nine ten like that 
cos there's an 8 p m departure 
tha... uh i think that's 
there's an 8 p m departure on Air Canada
it's flight 4 6 0 7 
it arrives into Toronto at 8:55
that's out of Toronto at 10:30 p m 
i'm it leaves Ottawa
4 6 0 7 leaves Ottawa at what time 
there's an early Air Canada connection through Toronto again 
it's uh flight 1 8 0 9 out of Ottawa at 6:50 a m 
i think tha... this is enough for him to consider 
and i'll get back with you 
this is B C at WWW 
i was wanting to make some arrangements for a trip that i'm going to be taking uh to LA 
and i'll be right with you here 
and you said you wanted to travel next week 
i i... have to be in LA a couple of different places actually on the 19th and 20th 
i'm going to be down in San Diego on personal business uh the previous weekend
the 16th 17th and 18th 
and basically i have to get into eh eh or near the Ontario airport for the Sunday night 
and i leave out of the Irvine which i guess is John Wayne Airport on the Tuesday 
i guess the first question i had was uh are there flights from San Diego to the Ontario airport in uh in LA or outside LA 
i guess if 
if there's a real problem there
i might keep a car which i'll have and simply drive up 
there's only two direct or non-stop flights from San Diego to Ontario 
and they're both in the morning on Sunday 
i think i'm going to forget that 
otherwise i'd be i'd be routing you through um through Los Angeles 
i... i... it would be Monday uh uh Sunday night yeah 
there's a like i say a 7 a m flight in the morning 
i'll do it under my own steam 
i'll just keep the rent a car that i'll have for personal reasons uh for that weekend 
you want me to 
so what it boils down to is just one flight getting out of there 
it wi... will be near the John Wayne Airport i guess
it i... it is John Wayne in Irvine 
we're going to have a pretty full day meeting on the on Tuesday the 20th 
i think i ought to be looking at a flight out of there perhaps no earlier than round about 7 o'clock 
there's an American flight at 7:30 
i was going to say that if i had my choice i'd pick American simply because i've got the uh advantage 
i i'm sorry
we've got you on American flight 9 3 0 8 
and that is 99 dollars one way 
and uh i think that's going to do it those two ho... hotel reservations and and the one flight 
you're all set then 
thank you very much for your help 
he's returning on the 13th of June on United flight 1 1 1 8 
and the fare is 234 dollars and 64 cents 
you said you had a second reservation 
we are 
the second reservation is for D E 
he wants to go San Francisco to Phoenix on Monday June 17th
we've requested Southwestern flight 6 7 8
and as i say request
because they're not in our system
we will actually phone and have to confirm this reservation with 
he's on United flight 4 3 6 leaving Phoenix at 6:35 p m 
and the fare on this is 162 dollars 
you're quite welcome
this is business 
i'm going to be leaving May 1st 
it looks like San Jose 
i have an appointment Monday afternoon at San Bernadino 
and uh i have appointments on Tuesday um in the City Commerce and in the Santa Ana areas 
it looks like probably the best connections are to go out to Ontario and to come back by way of Orange County 
whether that's gonna 
it won't 
it really won't affect the cost 
we can get you a seven day advance purchase 
that's gonna be two fifty eight round trip instead of two ninety 
un... unless you're staying over a Saturday night 
i need to uh 
my appointment is at 2 o'clock 
it looks like i 
i just looked at the airline guide 
it looks like there are two American Airlines flights out of San Jose 
one's at 9:50 
and the other 9:25 
it gets in at ten thirty 
that's on Alaska 
9:50 is American 
it would be the same airfare 
it's just up to you which time would be better or if you have a preference 
they're both in 
it shouldn't be ba... too bad traffic-wise 
i guess Alaska has a snack on it and American doesn't 
that's a little later 
that's the 9:50 you say 
that's flight 14 13 
and it leaves San Jose 9:50 a m 
i would imagine we could depart around 5 
and you wanted to leave from Orange County correct 
i think so 
the appointment's going to be right near Orange County 
American has a 5 p m flight 
or they have a 6 p m 
the 14 96 is the 5 right 
i'd almost i'd almost say uh the 5 ought to be able to do it 
you would be eligible for the 2 58 fare 
but the ticket would need to be issued today 
if you want to change that return 
you'd have to give me a call by this afternoon 
or unless you wanted to go with the fare that had no penalty 
which would be 2 96 
if i change the return 
then i'm 
you need to do so by by 
it's not something 
if i if i changed en route er while i was there 
that would be a penalty 
then it would be a 25 percent penalty 
i i suspect that uh i suspect the uh 5 o'clock is ok 
we better do the 6 
if we wind up having a productive meeting 
i'd hate to have to push it short for 25 percent penalty included 
tha... that's true 
i can confirm you on the 6 o'clock flight 
which is flight 3 6 2 
i believe so 
and we want to go ahead with the 258 dollar fare that 
if that's the best 
if you stayed over Saturday 
we could get it down to a 124 dollars round trip 
the only thing is that i do need to have the um charge number and the travel advance before we can issue 
i'm calling about a trip for C D 
this is his Montreal trip
and that's on Monday 
i see it here 
and he needs to go to Montreal 
and i understand another group has made the reservations 
so i need to get the information on that 
just the information about what we have 
he's on American flight 2 6 2 
that's out of Chicago at 7:10 a m 
it's Tuesday the 25th 
that's an American flight out of 
i missed 
these are all 
these are all American 
that's out of Chicago at 9:50 p m 
this is B
this is A from American Express 
we need to get a ticket for him from Boston 
this is a new reservation 
and he is um 
he wants to fl... he wants to fly from Boston 
i'm sure it's Piedmont P L P I 
and this is on the 21st of June 
that's Piedmont 1 9 0 9 on the 21 of June 
and then he wants to return from um Baltimore Washington 
and he requests flight 3 2 3 TWA 
it's two flight numbers
it's 3 2 3
and then it changes to 7 5 1 at 5:16 in the afternoon
this is to San Jose did you say 
i understand it's to San Francisco 
i think he's aware of it 
but i think we picked this one because um he could get the business traveller 
he can also 
the non-stop is at 4:40 arriving 7:05 
it's a non-stop from Dulles to San Francisco 
maybe he can't leave that early 
if it's it's still available 
i know subject to availability 
i've been giving you quick numbers here 
it's ok 
it's all right
i was quoted 6 0 8 50 for the whole round f... from Boston to Washington 
this portion was for Baltimore San Francisco only 
it's 6 0 8 50 that has to be ticketed by the 15th of June 
there are no cancellation or change penalties 
if any changes are made 
it's just subject to whatever the new fare is 
it has to be ticketed by the15th of June 
there are no penalties for cancellation if changes are made 
it's subject to whatever the new fares are at that time 
cos they're going to increase the fare 
but there's no penalty existing 
there's no penalty uh if it's cancelled 
the non-stop flight seems to be more appealing to me 
this man travels so much though 
 we're going to hold 
we'll just go ahead and hold the um 
then i will inform him of the Dulles flight at fou... 4:40 
it's San Francisco 
that's what he wants 
it's still 6:08 any which way we do this 
i'm just thinking the convenience of the traveller 
i think you get that same fare  
i think it that would have to be using a 25 percent penalty on TWA 
it would be 20 dollars more if he wanted to have a fare without a penalty 
you have to take a 25 percent penalty fare 
if you don't 
then it's 469 
so it would increase that total fare by 20 dollars 
it's 608 plus 20 
if he wanted to go without a penalty
it's 6 plus 20
he needs the cheapest rate possible on this one 
that would be row nine seat number five 
which is an aisle seat 
he's already purchased his ticket 
this is just all one way travel 
that was available
and i requested that 
i'll call you back on the Dulles non-stop flight so we'll 
if if he needs that right 
if he needs that 
and if he does get that
he has to pay uh 20 dollars more 
if he wants to take a fare without a penalty
if he's willing to take it with a penalty
it would be exactly the same fare 
i i hesitate uh for him particularly to get anything uh because he does change a lot 
so i i'd rather get the 20 dollars 
but we'll see what he says 
you are A right 
i'm A 
i'd like to make a reserv... some reservations please 
and we need to do the same thing we've done once or twice before 
and it's gonna be for May 11 if you're at that point yet 
but this is his route 
he wants to take a Piedmont flight that leaves Phoenix aimed for Baltimore at 10:30 in the morning 
and then he wants to connect with another Piedmont flight from Baltimore to New York 
i show a a Piedmont flight f... at 9:25 a m  
i don't show a 10:30 one 
and what day from um 
wherever Saudia flies out of to Riyadh 
he just thinks that Baltimore is the most efficient route to get to JFK from Phoenix 
and we're looking for economy 
not business or first 
you're looking for uh Saudi Arabian a... Airlines 
i guess it'd probably at the night of the 11th 
that's what i'm looking at 
it is sold out 
that's not a good new 
that's not good news 
i'm showing economy on Pan Am is open 
we have to get him to Riyadh one way or another 
we don't know when t... he's gonna come back yet 
but it'll be the same routing 
if you have to 
we've got him on Piedmont flight f... 11:54
it's Piedmont flight  
if you want to look that up
and i'll look at 
it's B 
he's leaving on 6 5 
we need to
that's a on...
he needs  
so we need to take an earlier flight 
i'm going to put you on hold for just a second while 
i'm back 
we do have a Delta flight that lands at 5:20 
it leaves Orlando at 4:30 
there's also a Braniff flight at 4:15 departing
that gets in at 5:14 
and those are the only ones i have right up you know before 6 
there's also earlier flights getting in a little after 4 
if we go from Orlando to Miami on the Delta 
that would probably be all right 
we can we can go with that one if you want 
i guess you've already got his tickets 
you should
they were run on the 31st 
when G was 
they were run yesterday 
maybe she just hasn't gotten around to calling you with them 
but i mean that's no big deal
we could always uh always change them now 
and if we would just reissue the whole ticket 
it was ticketed at a fare of 1091 
and if we go
we could get it for um 1079
because the Delta flight would price lower than the uh Continental he had been booked on 
if we just go ahead and reticket the whole thing 
you want to go ahead and and go with the Delta flight 
it's flight 8 6 5 on Tuesday the 6th 
i'd like to make a personal reservation 
my name's B 
ju... i i'm going to make this reservation for some another individual 
it'll be one person 
i'd like it on my American Express card 
and that's spelled how 
and the first name 
and this is travel from what city to what city 
i'd like to find out 
i'd like to get the cheapest rates you can 
th... there's a flight 
this is on the 5th of September 
i'm not sure they're operating on the 5th 
i show that schedule for American flight 1 4 4 0 on the 5th of December of 1 9 9 9 operating just San San Jose to San Diego 
they must of changed all their flight numbers 
i show
what i need to do is have someone go from Orange County to Lake Tahoe 
they had a month ago 
1 4 4 0 started at 6:54 a m 
they've changed 
he's not stopping in San Jose 
he's going th... the most direct route to Or... to Lake Tahoe 
what they have now 
the flight number for December is 5 5 8 
that's the schedule for December 
and that is available what with the return date that would be on that 
it'd be the same day 
that's that's in September right 
the 5th of September 
tha... i i thought you said December 
i can get that the 5th of September 
and it's returning on the same day 
there's a direct flight at 3:30 p m 
that's a flight that st... uh goes through San Jose 
i'm just thinking 
connection would be at 4:25 through San Francisco 
i'm i'm thinking this is a minister that's going to be doing a wedding 
it's a little important to have enough time 
that would be American 4 7 9 on the 5th of September 
the airfare is 264 round trip 
they don't have any discounts without a Saturday night stay 
that's that's ok now 
that's uh uh uh 
that's a fully changeable ticket also 
if he needs to change that or take a later flight
he can do so 
you do have a fl... a flight through SF that's leaving at 4:20 you said 
you want to write down what the schedule is on that 
so if he needs to know that or 
i'll remember this one 
that's a 4:25 arriving John Wayne at 7:41 
i don't think there's anything after that 
there is one later at 6 6:17 
it'll be one or the other of these 
those are both confirmed 
he's not been to Tahoe before and  
that sure is 
i can confirm him 19F going out and 19A returning 
we'll be picking him up 
everything'll be just fine on that now 
i want to make sure you get the pr... the right B 
it's um credit card there 
there's two of us at least now 
and you are 
i do have that credit card 
and i will put it in right now so i have it 
and if the expiration date says it's expired 
you can extend it two years 
this this actually is really old 
we have 87 
so i guess we extend it 4 years on this 
i... it it just got 
when i got it reissued 
they asked me before about that 
and they said  
but now it's good until 
i've put that in there
and if and if you just want me to verify 
i can verify with you the number 
i'll just i'm sure it's the same 
whenever it gets done 
i can have it over there like the 11th 
that would be Tuesday 
that'd be Tuesday 
that'll be fine 
this is AB 
and i'd like to make some travel reservations 
i need to go to Southbend Indiana 
and i want to go on United via Chicago 
there's uh 
i want to go from Chicago to Southbend on i believe it's United Express 2 6 8 6 
that leaves at 4:50 
there's a 10 a m flight out of San Francisc that connects fairly well with that 
it's flight 1 2 6 
it's a little less than an hour 
the next one earlier leaves at 6:50 
 which is an awfully long wait 
it's United flight twent... uh 1 2 6 out of San Francisco at 10 a m 
i'm leaving August 9 
you're going to get your own way between 
i want to leave uh Chicago somewhere around 5 p m 
there's a  
that sounds 
4:50 sounds good 
that's United flight 1 7 5 
it leaves 4:50 p m and arrives San Francisco at 7:08 p m 
i don't need any hotels 
i'm i'm all set 
i'll i'll 
i need a car in 
i'll i'll worry about the car in Southbend myself 
i'm i'm all set on that one 
you're confirmed on that one 
if i happen to miss a flight 
the next later flight's American at 5:20 
there's a United at 6:26 
so there are options 
i'm all set then 
i'll have the ticket's over to you today 
i don't need the tickets today 
i'll go ahead and run them generally 
she'll call you 
if you don't want to pick them up right away 
how you doing 
i have two reservations to make 
this is for Mr C 
one of them is 
cos i like him 
i'm glad 
the 2nd of August 
he's going to Washington 
i should have bet you
we'll be going to Denver Colorado this time 
and when about 
we're talking 18:30 or 19 
we can get him that 6... 18:40 rather 
he'll come back on the 3rd 
i can get her get him on a 14:10 flight 
it's Continental at 15 hundred 
we've got him on United flight 3 4 6 on the 2nd of August 
they don't want to talk to me 
it goes that way 
the other person 
i will call you back with the charge number 
i'm planning a trip to Japan at the end of uh the beginning of July 
and i have to be there on Monday morning 
i was just wondering what time i uh you know what's the uh the latest i could leave 
and i'm speaking with 
you you just need a schedule you said 
i i can't travel on Saturday
the latest the earli... i could leave Saturday night 
this is to Tokyo 
i don't think they're going to have service that late 
the latest would be uh 1 p m arriving 3:35 p m 
i can't
we... if you give me the days
i have 
so if you left on a Saturday 
you would arrive o... on a Sunday their time 
i... i need to arrive there you know either uh uh their time Monday early you know 
in the middle of the night would be acceptable to me anytime 
so i can get to an office by 
you'll have to leave on a Saturday
because if you won't
if you leave on a Sunday 
you're not gonna arrive there till in the afternoon 
i... i... 
i can't leave until after 10:30 or 11 o'clock at night 
the only the only way you're going 
i... it's really going to be crazy routing to do it that way 
but this is the only way to leave at night 
would have to be to fly all the way to the east coast um to fly to JFK 
so you'd be kind of going backwards 
but that's the only way that you'd be leaving at night 
it's either 
it's it's either i leave on Wednesday
or i leave on Saturday night 
let's see which way we can do this 
it i... i... i could leave to to uh JFK on Saturday night 
it would be like a 10:30 p m 
that's going to get into Newark  
it's going to go via Newark
it's 10:30 p m 
that's still going to arrive on Monday 
i think the uh you know 
that's no good 
all the flights are afternoon 
they don't offer any morning flights to Tokyo 
they're still going to get you in in the afternoon on Monday 
if they leave 
there's a flight
so i need to leave Saturday night or around midnight 
if i leave much after two in the morning on Sunday 
then i i i won't be able to make a Monday morning 
th... th... that's a direct flight so you were looking 
i guess you could either look under arrivals at Tokyo or departures on Saturday night Sunday morning 
the one i gave you is Sunday morning 
that's the third one 
but that's too l... 
that's the earliest 
they don't have anything else 
they don't offer 
as i said they don't offer night service from the west coast to Tokyo 
you'd have to fly all the way to the east coast
but you're defeating the whole purpose 
because you're you're gonna still arrive Monday at 1 2 in the afternoon 
so you'd be flying 6 extra hours 
i i i won't do that of course 
they don't have morning service that will get you there any earlier 
and they don't offer night service from the west coast to Tokyo 
but you're flying back across the US to go to Tokyo 
but i could do other business 
but you're still getting 
you're not saving 
i guess i don't don't need 
there's 
you mean two in the afternoon i would arrive 
that's in the afternoon 
and that's it huh 
i leave here 
you'd leave here Thursday 
Thursday is what time 
the earliest if it's available would be the Japan Airlines 
you want to do San Francisco 
i'm trying to find out which arrival is the earliest 
they have connections that get you in at 1:55 
you could conceivably get in earlier 
if you wanted to uh leave San Francisco at 7 a m 
i have to be there for the July 4th weekend 
it's the last week of June 
the 28th is a Wednesday  
i have to arrive on a Friday 
i have to arrive Friday 
this would arrive 
the routing that you suggested to Los Angeles 
cos that was on a Wednesday 
i'm looking on a Thursday 
it's a business trip 
so you could fly business Los Angeles Tokyo 
cos the schedules to Los Angeles Japan Airlines doesn't service a service on Thursday  
so it would be a Korean Airline 11 a m arriving 2:10 on Friday 
but then you... you're probably just as easy to take 
a non-stop out of San Francisco departs at 12 and gets in only about 30 minutes later than that 
there's there's a United 
it looks like  
if i leave on Thursday
i could do about 3 o'clock in the afternoon into Tokyo 
there's a 12 noon arrives 2:45 
it's non-stop from San Francisco to Tokyo 
cos there aren't that many seats on that 
i i uh i just want to make the reservation to make sure i have a spot 
we don't have yet either 
that's United 8 1 9 on the 29th of June 
and that is a non-stop flight 
and then you're gonna call back with the rest of the itinerary on this 
my the traveller is C 
it's for eh the outbound would be on June 17th 
and it's on US Air flight 2 7 8 2 
and i believe it's departing at 12:25 p m 
this traveller is making 
this is something out of the ordinary now 
it says reservations for CC and his wife and 
and then i'll have to call US Air to find out if if we're allowed to make her reservations 
sometimes you have to make it directly with the airline 
and if we can make it
i'll go ahead and do it 
otherwise you'll have to call US Air 
and this is on US Air 2 5 1 1 
and again this return flight will be for CC and his wife 
i know 
you'll have to check that one too 
i'll check the whole thing 
we have enough advance purchase time that i can get a non-refundable fare on the return 
would bring that portion down to 29 dollars one way 
but i'd have to t... issue the tickets today 
i think it's 1 9 0 8 
this is for B 
i've got that
it arrives at 4:23  into Dallas 
the only thing that's going to apply is full coach 
and that's 946 one way 
em it's from Birmingham to em London Euston please
the eighth of October
i'd like to leave on the 7 33 train
there's the 7 33 from Birmingham New Street

it's just so long as you have the letter of authorisation giving you permission to use the company credit card on like off... official headed paper that's ok
i can't actually take it with me
i'm going to give you the details
what i'm saying is you don't need to take the card
but you need a letter of authorisation
and it must be on the company headed paper
that's fine 
the credit card number please
45 pounds 50 will be debited from that account 
and this is your reference number to quote tomorrow at Euston station
and the ticket will be waiting there at the train station
i've already spoken to somebody earlier
he has a a family railcard
the rest of the adults pay 30 pounds 70
and it's 
 you said 1 44
i'm going to have to arrange for the person to collect the tickets at the train station
if you just bear with me
i'm just going to get a booking form to fill in refax to the train station
the 15 35 on Sunday from Euston arrives back in Warrington Bank Quay at 18 03
then the outward service tomorrow in 8 34 arrives at London 11 15
it's 4 adults and 4 children on 6 family railcard
but then there's the 
4 of them will go on the railcard
one'll have to pay a normal fare  
it's 4 adults and 4 children with the family railcard discount
and the total cost is going to be 155 pounds for the four adults and four children
we need to actually fill out the form twice because it's classed as two separate journeys 
it's a diner's card erm 
postcode i don't know
i need the full credit card address
the only thing i've got is his number 
i don't have an address
but we do need the credit card address details
we 
it's i've got it
it's American Express
i'm afraid i can't take the booking until you find the appropriate address
he's not
he's in a meeting
i'm afraid you... we're going to have to wait until he comes out of the meeting then and give the ring back to book this 
you just need the credit card's address
we need the full credit card details address 
if you hold on
i can get it off anoth... another person
i've got a 
i'm using a credit card to pay for this
erm i'm wondering if there's any erm seats available on the super saver
      it's going from 
it's either 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock
that's no good 
that is a super saver is it
that's the super advance
that's it 
you have a you have a super saver one as well don't you 
that's the 
i don't know what you super saver
ah there's two there's two types i'm told 
there's the super saver
the super advance
you've got to book beforehand
but that's only available in the dates and times
the super saver is not valid at that time in the morning
and that's your standard open
i can do that for you
it's the sixth of October
and i've booked forward facing non smoking table seats
and the dates times and seat numbers will be printed on the tickets for you
if you needed to change any times you can do so
if you miss any train you can get the next available service
you can cancel cancel that any time 
cos it's a standard open ticket
it's er Barclay card
it's Visa Silver
that's ok
the ticket will go out in the first class post this afternoon
i should get it tomorrow
i see
the credit card number is
this is the reference number the ticket has been booked under
and the ticket will be posted out first class post this afternoon to you ok now
but it's also printed on the tickets as well
i... it's just a single ticket
i think it's the tenth anyway
the trains run at quarter past and quarter to the hour
the cheapest single fare is 7 pounds
and that's your Virgin Value single
but you've got to stick to the date and time that you book
there's a train at 13 15 from Birmingham New Street 
you arrive in London Euston at 15 hundred
that sounds fine
you want me to book that ticket 
and that's 7 pounds for your single
it's the tenth of October Saturday 
you're travelling from Birmingham New Street at 13 15
and you must stick to the date and the time that you've booked with this kind of ticket
i just have a question first before i i purchase my ticket 
there is s... some restrictions with the saver return
if you just bear with me 
i'll get them for you
with the saver ticket you can travel on any train after 6 20
if you're travelling back on a Sunday
it's any train
but if you're travelling on a weekday Monday to Friday 
you can travel on the train after 
but you're not allowed to travel on the 16 hundred 16 05 17 hundred and 17 05 
basically if it's the Sunday you were travelling back
you come back at any time
i can't travel down after 6 in the morning
that leaves it open
oh that's good 
you need to buy it at the booking office before your board the train
or i can provisionally book it and arrange for you to collect the tickets at the train station
as long as you are a credit or debit card holder
whether or not you might not manage to get on that particular train
if the seats were all booked or if it was busy 
but this is like a walk on fare
and it's what you'd always be charged as long as you're travelling at the appropriate times
cos that i'd know what train i was taking down there
but i'd need to definitely get on that train
if i book it for a certain time going down 
you can do that with this kind of ticket 
or it might be one after
but it won't be earlier than that
i'll just check the time 
you want me to book that one for you
if if that's poss...
just so i can make sure i've got a seat on there 
i mean...
it might i might be going on a later train
but it won't matter if the ticket says that time will it
i'm just going to book your seat now
the only seat that i can reserve you in is in the smoking coach 
that train must be particularly booked 
the only seats are left are in smoking
that's that's alright
and that's smoking
and that's on the 15 20 train tomorrow from Preston 
just get the arrival time again
erm i'll leave the return journey open yeah
you can leave it open for the calendar month 
if it's a Sunday you're coming back
y... come back at any time
but there is those restrictions on the week day that i've explained to you
it's 7
and it's Lancashire
it's 0 1 8 hundred

the total price is 51 pounds return travelling tomorrow on the 15 20 train
that's the second of October
it's a Mastercard
and the Mastercard number is
it's 7 8 3 3
it's the four of the first
it's em the year two thousand and one 
it sounds funny when they 
if you collect the tickets 90 minutes before departure time at the train station 
at Preston you just need to go to the travel centre
and you'll have the tickets there 
you'll need to quote this reference number
it's  8 8 0 9
you just quote that reference number tomorrow 
and the ticket will be waiting there for you
and if by chance em 
it's just getting out of work on time but 
the next one's 16 20
then there's a 16 31 then 17 20
they're 20 past the hour apart from there's one at 16 31

the 17 25 returns arrives in Euston at 19 08
the cheapest fare is 14 pounds for the Virgin value fare each
but that 9 05 is booked up on the outward service
i'm just checking to see what's the nearest time to that is a... is available 
there's the 8 05 or it's the 9 35
i'll go for the 9 35
and that's on the thirty first of October 
the dates times and seat numbers will be printed on the tickets for you 
you must cancel by 6 o'clock the day before travel 
you would receive a 50 percent refund less 5 pounds 
if you had to change in the time of travel
